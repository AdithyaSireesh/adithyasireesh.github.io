Excited to share that our team from the Quantum Software Lab at the University of Edinburgh has advanced to the semifinals of the Google Quantum Applications XPrize 2025!

We competed on a challenge involving molecular dynamics simulations for graphene, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with quantum computing for materials science.
