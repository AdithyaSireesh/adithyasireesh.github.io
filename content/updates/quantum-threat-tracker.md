The Quantum Threat Tracker (QTT) is an open-source tool developed to help organizations assess when quantum computers will become powerful enough to break current encryption standards like RSA and Diffie-Hellman.

Built with support from Ofgem, Cambridge Consultants, and the University of Edinburgh, QTT provides resource estimation and threat timeline analysis for post-quantum cryptography planning.
